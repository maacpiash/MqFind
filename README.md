A few minutes ago, I found out that the functionalities I wanted to implement in this project are already built into the website, which can be found [here](https://find.accommodation.mq.edu.au/listings/rooms) for rooms and [here](https://find.accommodation.mq.edu.au/listings/properties) for properties. Therefore, there is no need for this project. It remains on GitHub as a helpful guidance for future Node.js projects, in terms of setup of development tools and `devDependencies`.

This project would have been my humble homage to [OpenCRVS](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core) — the project that taught me *almost* everything regarding web development during my time at [@DSInnovators](https://github.com/DSInnovators). The file and directory structure, frameworks and libraries (Hapi/React/TypeScript), development tools (Yarn, Lerna, Prettier, Husky), deployment tools (Docker Compose) of this project were chosen to keep it as similar as possible to OpenCRVS.

So, there goes my eight months of work ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
